wont go borrow anything dont find international investments get much higher returns want well right think reasonable approve plan rate run expected market lower return would seem reasonable given cost funding company cost capital asking higher return could 558 isnt used remember used plus 200 35 even conceptualized differently though dont think forget future regulator may decide talking cost capital even low taken account environment income statement suffer payout could go goes youll say well whats behind well regulator wouldnt like us paying everything comes main rationale isnt anyway

refurbish put good stead assets properties could work mean could guide us cash position currently hold eur 350 million cash eur 600 million liquidity position seems little bit stretch given 40 ltv views going manage cash second question wault signing xmadrid project last office think ismael commented big release madrid market could comment relating inaudible merlin achieved releasing spread would questions  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo  starting renewed inaudible flat renewal significant size 42000 square meters really reason despite accelerating trend release spread numbers year remain look lower year let counting increase unfamiliar way company calculates release spread sample anything last year portfolio operation around 1000 1260000 less square meters offices conveyed market information around 16 rent renewed year represented many outoftown buildings represented around 20 square meterage region 300000 change sorry 260000 less square meters look office information trading update full year 2018 results page see sum number renewal number add 260000 sample full encompassing everything every time renew somebody included connected take position lower rent somebody included numbers terms xmadrid wault think dont know believe region years check assume talking relatively standard lease contracts true operators first time operators shopping centers assume signing standard commercial contracts havent received petition shopping centers division change operational procedures shorten especially contracts specific assets top shopping center know cost base relatively humble means dont need extremely exigent rent point toward interesting ocr tenants first interested party seeing center thrive progress coming years us center concept want test whether concept works seeing lot interest different retailers cater market young population little bit lost many way gather data interesting present radical new concept like one got capex funding make simple map leave aside existing cash using continue paying debt forward thinking capex actions including best iii would consume region eur 700 million less generating around eur 250 million cash flow retention period eur 250 million match cash flow retention eur 450 million eur 500 million obviously rotation assets noncore sale calculate math year really continue policy rotating assets deem appropriate taking account also situation market sources uses come  alvaro sorianodemiguel societe generale cross asset research equity analyst  okay one tiny followup disposal target eur 450 million need comply year ismael socimi regulation probably last year surpassed threshold maximum profit coming rents mean coming capital gains would little followup  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo  yes things one eur 450 million eur 500 million target commenting within 4year plan rush year second yes comply socimi regime means need make sure asset sales book little complicated understand type transition works make relatively simple asset sales generate fiscal capital gain need combined asset sales generate physical capital loss means need sell combined assets make sure year compliant regime weighting sales could little bit muted necessarily lets see happens year true eur 500 billion eur 450 million target within next years rush grow profit base also precise let know single rotation assets sale assets drive reaching socimi regime end counts whether holding asset years end dont look backwards year national rating assets narrowing would held company years every single location imply potential breach socimi regime latest assets going past year threshold show october means might see asset disposals taking place towards end year  operator  next question line inaudible  unidentified analyst  couple questions first relates office portfolio madrid outside m30 wanted know extent concern vacancy reduction story seems like occupational market spoiled choice terms amount stock already doubledigit vacancy potentially stock coming online second question relates capital allocation think acknowledged start presentation whilst private market side turbulent public market given nav discount extent merlin open idea really upping ante making selective disposals using proceeds reduce debt priority share buybacks rationale reduce financial risk profile provide kind cushion underlying property risk unravels lets say example retail portion portfolio peripheral office locations  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo  well second one relatively easy inaudible suggests factors weathering mean trying reduce leverage know second part typical real estate cycle decompression phase ended rental acceleration phase beginning particularly offices laggard terms rental acceleration well rental acceleration offices know use part cash flow taking second phase cycle second part cycles reduce total debt figure attack comfortably change cycle happen sooner later future depend also external factors spain particularly guilty time around excesses cycle mean countries basis 100 capitol values like 72 76 basis 100 2007 know london new york 130 sooner later markets become negative real estate ripple effect felt spain time around also leverage big problem spain mean biggest company inaudible real estate commercial real estate spain 2007 82 leverage delivered combined 40 leverage big difference one thing first thing special ties first question dont think oversupply mean confronted legends terms oversupply number times particularly big research teams like years ago talked million square meters coming market people didnt see cranes new supply inaudible would difficult quantify tried super significant true media talking airport redevelopment airport redevelopment nieces probably grandchildren probably cope kind new supply offices coming whatever inaudible shop san martin whose welcome move city towards north madrid yes million square meters take lot time first complete infrastructure works take lot time materialize nothing really relevant yes one says want develop plot land north castellana area significant mean bear us see lot inaudible activity called a1 corridor north castellana first half year working number contracts number inaudible lease see significant jump occupancy way paired pressure rent yes talk doubledigit vacancy double vacancy comes 227 years ago 11 ill soon asking learning student soon goes 10 normally inaudible factor part vacancy normally past experience cycles normally means inaudible inaudible market show upset fact might know number optimistic capital sources looking product outskirts madrid  operator  next question line pietro arias  unidentified analyst 10  first one offices likeforlike growth excluding huawei renault id like know could good reference growth coming quarters second one new wip regime portugal could share us may change terms local corporate structure initial estimate potential tax savings group level  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo 11  take second one regarding wip regime put place approved portugal said recently approved subject pluralities fully understand regulation true least first look reit able possible replicate system structure place spain parent company considered socimi entity 100 subsidiary considered socimi despite listed current reit regime announced implies least 20 lifting shares company getting higher detail also discussing inaudible exceed volumes already adjusted existing structure  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 12  second point go back ismael talking largest negotiation year tenant inaudible us take account looking forward guiding asset likeforlike evolution release spread excess weve gone weve done math weve looked said thats see based upon things weve already done current negotiations tenants place thats expectation weve offices 2019  operator 13  next question line bernard vitrac  benjamin paul richford crédit suisse ag research division research analyst 14  ben richford perhaps hear ben richford crédit suisse question best iii logistics development looks like geography changed quite significantly earlier investments logistics less focused core sort madrid barcelona could give comments around please secondly retails seen smallest valuation movement small decline valuers thinking mediumterm growth retail sort discussions around longer term likeforlike projections please  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 15  ill take second one first think actually ill take first one first case ismael said earlier part scale weve achieved logistics following customers fact serving customers market look past years looking buildtosuits clients said weakness distribution network iberian peninsula valencia weaknesses seville lot customer led terms broadening secondly look scale exposure madrid barcelona point opportunities really infill well continue things inaudible continuing things southport relative looking things outside going diminish thats law large numbers customer led terms following customer markets makes sense really want able provide source supply chain customers youre going want markets definition look opportunity given scale main markets going spending time looking building network also part hubandspoke strategy madrid barcelona big hub markets spokes go network second question value rarely talked forward talked happened last year imply valuation last year value typically inaudible portfolio increasing value even though marginal prior years one conversation much fitting strategy followed urban dominance value going solid potential grow look footfall sales growth generating likeforlike rental increase generating within portfolio theres going even take maintain cap rates constant youre going see value growth comes cash flow growth comes thats one theme comes whether value inaudible tenants thats want thats flagship oriented towards urban dominant following hearing people pay us rest  operator 16  next question jaap kuin  jaap kuin ing groep nv research division research analyst 17  affo guidance obviously youve already discussed moving parts needing acquisitions probably later date year limited impact affo probably movements shore like refurbishment pipeline could kind give us specific details numbers thinking understand lets say kind modest guidance affo first question  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 18  affo guidance look talking occupancy talking likeforlike spread thing keep mind look landmark program going reducing space buildings drive landmark programs reasons subject negotiations right never know youre going come agreement tenants move space want develop cautionary conservative prudent im going use word affo guidance know 40000 square meters space buildings going landmark plan thats going vacated year dont know theyre going vacate discussions prudent assuming happened maybe earlier sure overestimating second objective reduce leverage weve already reduced leverage significantly quickly projected benefited rise values weve left value rise lower leverage whereas leveraging value increase reason relatively conservative relatively prudent want use word affo projection want accomplish deleveraging year something formula watch market evolve watch happens occupancy sales happens economy may end external economy say quite comfortable whats happening spain moment may decide allocate cash deleveraging delever opposite side lower leverage impact ffos combination prudent positioned landmark plan thinking deleveraging revenue side cash flow side comfortable look occupancy going growth look release spreads comfortable going driving growth want prudent much might might vacate might apply leverage rather prior new acquisitions  jaap kuin ing groep nv research division research analyst 19  following share us implied likeforlike rent growth top level assume  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 20  well said earlier release spreads really guide market offices guiding release spread offices  jaap kuin ing groep nv research division research analyst 21  okay think second question would risk appetite regards logistics example dhl mercedes contracts nice run 3pl contracts contracts created equal type risk whats duration contracts whats general philosophy toward signing kind shortterm 3pl leases versus enduser contracts  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 22  well think look portfolio life like dynamics something dont look individual contract say isolation look contract impact wault company access located within regional dispersion portfolio whats risk individual operator put mix say situations think risk greater obviously push longer lease length cant always step back market decision whether layer decision top overall portfolio going time reduce weighted average lease length point uncomfortable large individual assets within overall portfolio theyre roughly less start take different kinds decisions dynamic risk analysis rather like word risk analysis frankly thats benefit larger players part resistance never really favored asset class individual investors cant take risk someone assets cant afford look say oh order fill building 3year lease kind going give bank guarantee kind corporate shelf narrow tool thats youve always seen big logistics dominated bigger players look dynamic risk analysis thats  jaap kuin ing groep nv research division research analyst 23  okay final question applies back guess first one delevering still targeting disposals retail could describe preference achieving deleveraging retail also still kind thoughts appetite investment part  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 24  would say look disposal plan disposal plan really around assets think arent best hands assets think given scale company given concentrations value think going create value across board constant conversations people disposal assets conversations peripheral office assets fairly advanced conversations several parties best nothing announce market nothing give specific data advanced conversations around numbers think work us retail specifically weve identified noncore assets ismael said earlier assets represent 22 gross asset value company generally speaking look footfall sales tenants likeforlike lease spread theyre performing theyre generally performing quite positively weve got patient dispose assets patient hotel portfolio worked quite well us patient residential portfolio worked quite well us know people feel differently retail performance assets us theyre performing portfolio tells us patient well time market dispose represented 15 portfolio id feel differently fact represents 22 portfolio afford take view patient get best execution possible thats best answer give  operator 25  next question max nimmo  maxwell wilson nimmo kempen amp co nv research division analyst 26  think questions kind answered slide page trying get idea long takes get pro forma essentially youre saying youre saying youve obviously rushed noncore disposals assume thats kind factored take entire development pipeline 22 23 would get pro forma wise secondly kind followup cg regime expect terms impact market terms think drive bit liquidity say lisbon office market example perhaps giving opportunities way  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo 27  thanks max well starting second yes believe cg regime bring new actors portugal eventually means assets may move market bringing us opportunities contrary may also mean cant really market may heat little bit believe market hot probably step aside leave people things wait future rush accomplish leadership position anything worried yes mean least like see market clearly dominated opportunity capital believe opportunities institutional buyers instance investors product may come market note product believe suitable portfolio eventually might pick pro forma pro forma yes pro forma simply pro forma mean end 2002 might see us 2022 might see logistics place however significant part ready already 2020 2021 yes right pro forma happen 2022 way well significantly affected commented noncore disposals eventually might reduce little bit shopping center figure little bit office figure  operator 28  next question line paul may  unidentified analyst 29  apologies youve already answered dialed bit late wondered congratulations initially delivering occupancy target credit wondered occupancy target going forwards especially madrid market still seems sitting group target wondering could give color would great  ismael clemente orrego merlin properties socimi sa executive vice chairman amp ceo 30  right look always dangerous give guidance occupancy order prudent thing say internal occupancy target year 91 better end year mainly would come madrid madrid move current 8810 886 slightly north 90 would internal target currently working significant number leads north castellana hopefully converts heightening occupancy madrid want see 900000 800 number  unidentified

competition go strictly market practices market rent mean releasing significant discounts know total incentive level 4pointsomething percent low mean far many things seeing european countries et cetera buildings premium product course push little bit demand particular building cant comment slightly theoretical erv although erv moves agent agent mean many ervs every part madrid agents cover part madrid reports  david michael brush merlin properties socimi sa cio 33  put little bit color right 30000 proposals market madrid conversion rate talked conversion rate thats math thing right proposals probability youre going get look thats part whats fed looking target occupancy thing beginning obviously inaudible every year every asset manager follow budget think building every time put proposal budget built built comps market every time put budget theres many things go whats net effect rent whats fit contribution whats free rent whats term whats base rent analysis every single proposal npv basis say npv basis exceed budget ismael said buildings think competitive advantage well push sales okay lets put proposal exceeds budget think thats accomplish situations think less competitive position may willing circumstances something even budgeted think strategic reasons isolated casebycase decisions build whole thing thats look release spread occupancy growth incorporates granular decisions every time take decision based upon rigorous analysis based upon input started bottom asset manager adjusted individual situation also dynamically keep using using word important may willing deal individual lease didnt meet overall budget im looking context dynamically whats happened either quarter happening towards achieving overall budget im managing overall budget keep

repurchase stock market like separate account us eventually well consider whether cancel well use swap assets potentially interest us cross bridge get river regarding ocr latest reported figure 126 lower past quarter would consider relatively low figure mean 10 overall referring havent seen kind figure easily past take account portfolio lowly exposed names normally trade low ocrs remember portfolio relatively low exposure index group like 12 like exposure primark hampm names normally trade superlow ultralow ocr therefore lower overall peers portfolios case given fact shopping centers open access trade specialized shops obviously run slightly higher ocr also shopping centers trade high numbers space per square meter ranks high within spanish equivalent happy ocr happy way shopping centers trading even though recognize borrowing significantly borrowing clients works disturbing reducing traffic reducing space per square meter setting apart part inventory works numbers shopping

sharing well first let remind group level roughly 130000 sites 90000 lte therefore probably one largest largest ultrabroadband fiber network territory therefore still significant room go order enhance return capital employed network sharing focusing towers mean focus example uk ctil owns operate roughly 18500 towers already largest tenant customers high financial profiles vodafone inaudible therefore current market environment significant intrinsic value vodafone aligning intention crystallize value think tower sales probably longer effective way executing transaction new accounting standards becomes expensive way financing therefore think effective ways executing transaction add amount towers uk fact telxius owns operate roughly 17500 towers 20000 towers germany better idea value asset could potential value creation debt reduction churn crystallize value assets expect us focused optimizing value time preserving competitive advantage wherever competitive advantage yes expect us active fronts  operator  next question comes line georgios ierodiaconou citi  georgios ierodiaconou citigroup inc research division director 10  actually mostly followups id interested could perhaps link discussion around network sharing disposal options available particular could give us bit idea around agreement brazil tim whether could replicated rest footprint links monetization options tower side second question around network virtualization theres obviously talk turning 3g europe next years 2g sharing operators network virtualization wanted get idea path see coming years reducing perhaps cost capital intensity industry numbers could give us inaudible numbers sound credible help appreciated  ángel vilá boix telefónica sa coo amp executive director 11  well start first question announced mou brazil tim open parties objective improving return capital employed allocating capex smartly ways first deprioritizing legacy technologies second sharing cost investment new technologies higher return technologies one leg agreement full 2g network sharing single grid format objective switching networks people want join additional networks one regions purely way deprioritizing making efficient return legacy technologies extended geographies footprint second leg agreement announced brazil sharing deployment 4g stage subset cities developed next 90 days parties approved regulators depending results analysis could increased cities ones originally envisioned also contemplate result work next 90 days opportunities share frequencies technologies always looking give away technological advantage also obviously include reduction opportunities regarding operations maintenance across networks different players deprioritizing legacy technologies making efficient investments new technologies  josé maría álvarezpallete lópez telefónica sa executive chairman amp ceo 12  taking second question sector think significant opportunity enhance roce network sharing every network element represent commercial competitive advantage candidate churn includes infrastructure access transport roaming agreements different alternatives offer full range possibilities passive active sharing considering depending markets relative market share makes sense ready give access brand new fiber network represents opportunity accelerate returns time preserve 2g 3g networks per country makes sense start deploying 5g without radically simplifying network sharing legacy technologies framework read agreements signed vodafone tim sitting one millicom colombia working speak several projects kind terms virtualization 5g namely parts virtualization core virtualization ran virtualization core advanced probably market leaders regard unica technology therefore also collaborating suppliers competitors see part 5g deployment optimize also sharing part virtualization discussed represent commercial advantage ran going depending evolution 5g therefore views nonstandalone 5g standalone 5g summary think going forward significant opportunity enhancing returns sharing absolutely nobrainer share legacy technologies decommission many networks sustainable future represent significant efficiency opportunity going forward regard mobile networks also fiber networks going essential remember largest fiber footprint therefore accelerating decommissioning copper namely spain presents significant efficiency opportunity  georgios ierodiaconou citigroup inc research division director 13  could quickly ask followup around brazil im guessing similar discussions single 2g grid countries brazil successful negotiation countries havent reached agreement yet  ángel vilá boix telefónica sa coo amp executive director 14  well brazil announced mou developing next 90 days need willing partner tim shown lots interest expect us looking type agreement one geographies working due course presenting market progress front josé maría said nobrainer

customers significantly lower churn rate getting third quarter scenario going start new season la liga last year vodafone managed retain certain number customers still weekly games la liga month august onwards would case football fans stayed vodafone look football elsewhere control whole premium football rights packaged one la liga package anymore separating best match week others including second division champions including europa league believe theres going active dynamic backtoschool time doubt maybe promotional intensity could lower seen last year need ask please repeat second

aggressively mobile  ángel vilá boix telefónica sa coo amp executive director 19  thank well seen results uk operation one quarter robust results outperforming market resulting strong commercial

first stimulation comments youve giving around network virtualization tower sharing mean understand correctly youre saying also correct im wrong sounds like youre saying youre increasing list views network differentiation maybe lets say core way perceived dont need different components differentiate network obviously many different parts youd happy share divest et cetera guess im trying understand look business going forward think key pillars differentiating mean network still core obviously spain content one key pillars differentiating digitalization obviously theres lot different pillars think differentiation trying protect business growing going forward thats first question second one really following various topics weve discussing spain near term much better peers obviously youre confident h2 broader question guess spain look spanish market versus rest europe one big differentiating points deployment cost infrastructure much cheaper one big advantages youve terms capital intensity think ability protect business backdrop obviously weve got change management euskaltel seem want go national youve got másmóvil aggressive unless youve got vodafone struggling lot market orange also bad numbers morning spain guess im trying understand differentiation spain maintain protect returns  josé maría álvarezpallete lópez telefónica sa executive chairman amp ceo 22  take first one network virtualization network sharing think network key differentiating factor fact pretty consistent invested roughly eur 29 billion capex last years therefore going one highest capex investment cycles history telefónica result built largest ultrabroadband network outside china doubled number lte sites doubled number customer base ultrabroadband doubled lte customer base built largest spanishspeaking pay tv platforms think network key differentiating asset investing heavily transforming network legacy networks like copper 2g 3g stateoftheart largegeneration ip network ready virtualized subject run artificial intelligence factor stress around network sharing fact makes sense antennas roof share therefore thats differentiating factor makes sense preserve 2g 3g networks every country move traffic namely data traffic network 4g tocome 5g networks think need preserve network differentiation competitive commercial advantage every part network infrastructure backbone backhaul differentiating factor candidate divesting makes sense invest different mobile technologies time would significantly affect return capital employed point network differentiation key factor multiplying number network dont competitive advantage makes sense namely legacy part network investing heavily keep order preserve competitive advantage sharing anything differentiating us peers hope answers question  ángel vilá boix telefónica sa coo amp executive director 23  listen regarding differentiating keep differentiating spain different components different segments instance b2c see market increasingly segmented polarized consequence 5convergence penetration low end significantly crowded national players present sometimes multibrands mvnos local players medium high end make

morning growing previous quarters base wholesale revenues slowing us accelerating continue able differentiate invested substantially business platforms  operator 24  next question comes david wright bank america  david antony wright bofa merrill lynch research division head developed emea european telecoms equity research director 25  couple questions firstly spain wanted get understanding right reviewing think one earlier questions could expect revenues accelerate return growth h2 b2c b2b little better wholesale similar youre also saying net content cost growth also slows im wondering youre getting relief pricing content costs youre really expecting margin broadly similar wouldnt better im really sorry struggle ebitda decline mean stable mean growth decline im struggling second question little bit high level probably josé maría youve seen fairly precipitous drop share price german subsidiary past months think guys look consider whole framework asset divestment also asset acquisitions could ever opportunity take advantage share price perhaps even look buy share market even consider acquiring minorities given market im sure would feel doesnt value asset correctly  ángel vilá boix telefónica sa coo amp executive director 26  david first question may reiterate expect acceleration service revenue growth second half compared seen first half regarding margin different moving pieces lower yearonyear growth net content cost second half versus first half still growth gross cost efficiencies people plans applying last years peaked first half year current existing plans going improving additional savings ones achieved already run rate different moving pieces us able achieve second quarter improvement percentage point oibda margin 398 organic ex ifrs remarkable maybe could expected bit lower see achieving second quarter back preifrs levels around already close 40 strong oibda margin thats think say expect margins broadly level expect oibda declining spain since 2009 expect decline 2019 declining decade revenues last year 2018 started increasing revenues spain 2019 accelerating increase revenues aiming revert saw declines could stable slightly positive oibda 2019

reach less end year 2030 8000 megawatts less case aware going happen future course aim improve position renewables merchant renewables dont discard could increase figure today relation clean dark spread well many things happen opinion important thing increase co2 perfectly know increase eur per ton co2 price impact 05 06 wholesale price impact 04 cost combined cycle 09 cost coal means increase co2 prices reduce clean dark spread coal nevertheless lets say gas prices increase future lets say least opinion seasonal situation one today decoupling brent ttf gas prices disappear trying recovering normal situation certain correlation prices expect increase daily price ccgts increase price wholesale increasing spread clean dark spread would depend factor mainly evolution nevertheless let say discovered lets say forward coal power plants regarding clean dark spread different spot prices lets say forward prices coal power plant produce means clean dark spread positive depends lot

needs densification aware 5g frequencies including band 35 ghz highest band among ones used today growth higher frequency lower values points presence frequencies going need higher densification however also 5g allocated lower frequencies like 700 mhz requirement densification come moment number users connected onto single pop big enough require densification beginning 700 mhz cover 5g much wider umbrella densification wait one elements mnos play wisely capex decide deploy 5g unless regulatory obligation deploy exactly case italy recall correctly october 2018 months ago frequencies granted mnos 72 months say years deploy 5g even cities 5000 inhabitants massive massive deployment technical difficulty seems logical looks technical difficulty reasonable well mnos sharing capex needs high densification 35 gigahertz going required meanwhile mitigating technical elements mnos may use order deploy high level densification another question  juan jose gaitan mañoso cellnex telecom sa head ir 25  italy play  josé manuel aisa mancho cellnex telecom sa cfo amp corporate development director 26  oh yes italy well going back reading press release formal thing talk eventual
